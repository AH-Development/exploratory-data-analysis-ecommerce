# 🛒 EDA - E-Commerce Product Performance

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset simulating product performance in an e-commerce context. The goal is to uncover insights related to pricing, discounts, customer satisfaction, return rates, and delivery efficiency.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores how various product-related attributes (price, discount rate, ratings, number of reviews, delivery time, etc.) influence product performance — especially return rates and customer satisfaction.

The dataset is synthetically generated but mimics realistic e-commerce behavior, making it suitable for data analysis and modeling exercises.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the impact of price, rating, and delivery time on return rate.
- Analyze product categories for performance trends and anomalies.
- Create actionable insights for business decision-making or model input.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Higher discounts often correlate with higher return rates** — possibly due to impulse buying.
- **Ratings and number of reviews are positively correlated**, suggesting customer engagement.
- **Long delivery times tend to be associated with more returns**, especially in certain product categories.
- Certain **categories consistently underperform**, which could help prioritize product audits.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Use findings to engineer features for predictive models.
- Develop an interactive dashboard.
- Integrate pipeline tracking via MLflow in upcoming MLOps version of the project.
