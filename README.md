## 🔍 Project Overview

This project explores the "E-Commerce Product Performance" dataset to uncover patterns and insights related to product success metrics in an online retail context.

Using Python and data visualization libraries, this EDA investigates how variables like price, discount rate, customer reviews, delivery times, and stock availability relate to product ratings and return rates.

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand how product attributes impact return rates and customer satisfaction
- Identify which categories underperform or excel
- Prepare insights for business or ML model usage

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Key Insights (examples)

- Higher discount rates tend to correlate with higher return rates
- Products with more reviews tend to have more stable ratings
- Certain categories exhibit longer delivery delays and higher return rates
